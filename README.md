# Pipeline in Python
How to create a pipeline in python

Python scikit-learn provides a benefit to automate the machine learning tasks.

The goal is to make sure that each one of the steps within the pipeline are constrained to the information available for the evaluation, like training the dataset or scaling the dataset or encoding the categorical values in the dataset. 
This is an immensely useful tool.
